## Dataset

This file contains GPS tracks for 10 colonies of 3 species of seabirds. The tracks have been shifted to remove their colony location (effectively setting their colony to 0, 0) for confidentiality reasons, this should have no effect on the results. If full tracks are needed, they are available on request, here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/predicting-animal-behavior-using-gps/
