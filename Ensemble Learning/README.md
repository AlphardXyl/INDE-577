## Dataset

The data was downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines.
