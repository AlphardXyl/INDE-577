# INDE-577

## Course Description
This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. We will implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch in python, but will also make use of, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- **Supervised Learning**:
    - Model Building and Error Analysis
    - Linear Regression
    - Gradient Descent
    - Logistic Regression
    - Neural Nets
    - Support Vector Machines
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Decision/ Regression Trees
    - Ensemble Learning

## Repository Description

For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in that week, a README file, and sub-repositories of dataset files (if applicable).

Programming language used in this repository is Python 3.
